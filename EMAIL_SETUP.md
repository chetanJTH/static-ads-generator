# Email Service Setup for Contact Form

## Overview
The contact form now sends emails to `info.kraftey@gmail.com` when users submit the form. This setup includes both notification emails to the admin and auto-reply emails to users.

## Environment Variables Required

Add these environment variables to your `.env.local` file in the frontend directory:

```bash
# Email Configuration for Contact Form
EMAIL_USER=info.kraftey@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password_here
```

## Gmail App Password Setup

To use Gmail SMTP, you need to generate an App Password:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Google Account
2. Go to **Google Account Settings** â†’ **Security**
3. Under "2-Step Verification", click **App passwords**
4. Select **Mail** as the app
5. Copy the generated 16-character password
6. Use this password in the `EMAIL_PASS` environment variable
